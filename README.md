# Image-Classification

This repository will give two different methods to perform image classification based on Keras modul or tensorflow. 
Keras use a CNN deduced from VGG with the number of layers depending on the number of classes to predict. 
Tensorflow modul use resnet_V1 and need to have at least 200 pictures per class to perform well.
